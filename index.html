    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Subham Soni, I am a sophomore at the Institute of Engineering & Managament.
        I am a highly motivated individual with a motive and goal oriented mindset.
        Recently I have completed my Freshman year with a Cgpa of 9.01 and since then I have been working on quite a few skills 
        whilst I am on my summer break like web dev and DSA.
        I have also recently been interested in UI/UX design and graphics related fields
        which I would like to explore more of.
        I am also interested and excited about AI and ML which are the evolving and trendy fields of the day.
